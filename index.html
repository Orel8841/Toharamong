            <h1 class="h13">The second step is to know all people's places if u are a crewmate and u stick with 2 ppl u have to remember who is those people to give him clear for this round and then Narrow down the possibilities to know the imposter if there is a body in the left side and you and 2 people were together all round at right side that means u guys are clear for this round and if there's an only 1 imposter that means u guys are fully clear and that help to narrow down possibilities to know who is the only guy who is not clear by someone else so he is probably the impostor

                <h1 class="h14">Now we are at step 3 in step 3 u have to know how to use admin a very useful tool that gives a lot of info about the game So maybe u asked yourself how can I use it? the first thing u have to do at admin is to remember people's places at this picture down below u can see all people's places and know if they lying about their places the second tip I can give u about admin is when u see a 2 people's at security and u see flashing at the admin that means somebody's kills there and if he reports the body u can know it's him 100% and also u can see vent though the map when u see a player at electrical and is gone and u see at the right moment somebody's in is a mad Bay that probably a vent from there to there so u can use it for advancer in the game also when your impostor u can use it to know where all people's places and kill in the right side and go with him at the left side to get an alibi
